# Metadata

This document records the current metadata baseline and the public-beta target
from [ADR 0006](adr/0006-metadata-freeze.md). The repository is still
pre-public-beta, so the golden fixtures in `test/fixtures/metadata/` are
characterization fixtures, not a final marketplace schema promise.

## Current Output

Off-chain metadata is URI-based:

- Pending randomness: `collectionBaseURI + "pending"`.
- Final randomness: `collectionBaseURI + tokenId` with the token ID as a
  decimal string.

The current contract does raw string concatenation and does not insert a path
separator. Operators must include the desired separator in `collectionBaseURI`.
For example, `collectionBaseURI = "https://example.com/collections/abc/"`
returns `https://example.com/collections/abc/pending` before randomness and
`https://example.com/collections/abc/123` after token `123` is finalized. Without
the trailing slash, `collectionBaseURI = "https://example.com/collections/abc"`
would produce `https://example.com/collections/abcpending` and
`https://example.com/collections/abc123`.

Current on-chain metadata is returned as:

```text
data:application/json;base64,<base64-json>
```

The current JSON includes:

- `metadata_schema_version` with value `6529stream-v1`
- `metadata_state` with value `pending` or `final`
- `name`
- `description`
- `image`
- `attributes`
- `animation_url` for final on-chain metadata only

Pending on-chain metadata no longer runs the final generative HTML path with a
zero token hash. It returns schema-versioned JSON with
`metadata_state: "pending"` and omits `animation_url`. Final on-chain metadata
returns schema-versioned JSON with `metadata_state: "final"` and the existing
base64-encoded HTML animation URL.

`StreamCore.metadataSchemaVersion()` exposes the active schema version and
`StreamCore.tokenMetadataState(tokenId)` exposes the current `pending` or
`final` state for minted tokens. The current schema version does not yet solve
JSON escaping, raw attribute validation, metadata size limits, freeze manifests,
dependency immutability, stale randomness display, or burn metadata semantics.

## Golden Fixtures

`test/StreamMetadataGolden.t.sol` compares live contract output against:

- `test/fixtures/metadata/offchain-pending-token-uri.txt`
- `test/fixtures/metadata/offchain-final-token-uri.txt`
- `test/fixtures/metadata/onchain-pending-schema-v1-token-uri.txt`
- `test/fixtures/metadata/onchain-final-schema-v1-token-uri.txt`

The on-chain fixture names include the schema version so later schema migrations
are reviewable and deliberate.

## ERC-4906 Events

`StreamCore` supports ERC-4906 through `supportsInterface(0x49064906)`.

The current event policy is:

- `MetadataUpdate(tokenId)` is emitted when a live token's randomness is
  fulfilled through `setTokenHash`.
- `MetadataUpdate(tokenId)` is emitted when `changeTokenData` writes a live
  token's generative input.
- `MetadataUpdate(tokenId)` is emitted for each token written by
  `updateImagesAndAttributes`.
- `BatchMetadataUpdate(fromTokenId, toTokenId)` is emitted when
  `changeMetadataView` writes the metadata mode for a collection with minted
  tokens.
- `BatchMetadataUpdate(fromTokenId, toTokenId)` is emitted when
  `updateCollectionInfo` writes collection-level metadata inputs for a
  collection with minted tokens, including base URI, display fields, library,
  dependency reference, or collection script chunks.
- Batch events use the collection's minted-ever contiguous token range. They are
  skipped while a collection has no minted tokens.

The current contract intentionally does not emit ERC-4906 events merely because
a token is minted. If the configured randomizer fulfills during mint, the
fulfillment itself emits `MetadataUpdate`. Burn also does not emit ERC-4906;
indexers should treat the ERC-721 transfer-to-zero event as the live-token
metadata removal signal.

Current freeze does not change `tokenURI` bytes, so `freezeCollection` does not
emit ERC-4906 yet. Future schema-versioned freeze manifests may add finality
fields and should update this policy intentionally. Dependency reference changes
through `updateCollectionInfo` emit batch events; dependency registry content
versioning and reverse collection-to-dependency signaling remain part of
P1-META-003.

## Public-Beta Target

ADR 0006 requires future metadata work to add:

- stale and burned-state policy
- JSON escaping and raw-attribute validation
- freeze manifests and immutable dependency version pins
- burn semantics and callback-after-burn tests
